# House-Pricing


This repo contains feature engineering project I have done on the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" competition hosted in Kaggle.

• The dataset is preprocessed, used Mutual Information Score to compute the utility scores of all features.

• Unsupervised Algorithms like k-means clustering and PCA were used for creating new features.

• Implemented XGboost model which reduced the cross-validated RMSLE score from 0.14351 to 0.12415 after Feature Engineering.
